Russian polygons
this is what Richard figured out:
         https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35438/maths-find-vertices-when-1-vertex-and-center-point-is-given-in-polygon
         "
Assume that center of the polygon has coordinates (x_0,y_0) and known vertice has coordinates (x_n,y_n). Also assume that we are considering n-sided polygon.
Coordinates of i-th vertce (0<i<n) can be calculated using this formulae
x_i = x_0+R*cos(a+2*Pi*i/n)
y_i = y_0+R*sin(a+2*Pi*i/n)
where
     _______________________
R = v(x_n-x_0)^2+(y_n-y_0)^2
a = acos((x_n-x_0)/R)"
       # Todo:
##### not necessary 1. Get location on the circumference of the circle between the center 
# ####   and each guard (equations for this derived)
# 1. Get the equation of the line from the prisoner to the guard
# 2. Get location of every vertex of the regular polygon
# 3. Get equation for the line segment for every edge of the polygon
# 4. For each line segment, determine if the line from the center 
#    through the guard intersects it. Sum the number of such times:
#    A. If it's zero, then the guard can't shoot the prisoner.
#    B. If it's one, then the guard can shoot if the distance from 
#       that point of intersection to the center is exactly equal to the 
#       radius.
#    C. If it's two, then calculate the distance from each point of
#       intersection to the center. If one such distance is greater than 
#       the radius and the other is less, then the guard can shoot the 
#       prisoner. 
It is implemented in polygons.py
There are some additions: turns out guards can be squashed by polygons,
and so can the prisoner.
Current implementation reflects that.
But apparently the problem is that we can't get the polygons' vertices if the polygons are in the third quadrant
(I think that's the one where x and y are negative)
so ultimately the challenge was unsolved.

BavBin:
	No xss in the pastes, far as I can tell (it's not in an interesting tag, and <> are escaped)
		There is a mode in the database which says that the ones I've made are text
		which implies I could make one that is something else, like html. But how????
	Search box does not seem sql-injectable
	"report" only accepts things that start with that IP.
		so use <ip>.mastodon.uwctf.ninja
		See index.html:
			javascript can't write files.
			but it can make requests that contain the cookie.
			provided the javascript can access the cookie
		same origin policy: we can get domains off of .bavarian.world (which we did for a different problem)
			tried <ip>.bavarian.world
			it does visit the link, but we cannot get the cookie
			maybe the domain for cookies is just the IP
			--> so the answer would be to somehow do an actual malicious paste...
