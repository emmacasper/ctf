mrs white:
	phone number does not go through -- 275 area code is not assigned
	comment says she's looking for Mr. /Boddy
	so go to /Boddy and get flag
	TUCTF{1_4ccu53_Mr5._Wh173_w17h_7h3_c4ndl3571ck_1n_7h3_c0mm3n75}
miss scarlet:
	/Boddy: comment "Maybe look into how easy it would be to receive some tissues in the 'post'"
prof plum:
	/ leads you to /research if you want to apply
	/researcher.php says you have to find mr boddy, and tells you to look at /looking.php
	/looking.php says "maybe try somewhere else in the mansion?"
	you can submit a place to look, but none of them work!
	post runs /signup.php, but trying to look at that just redirects to /looking.php
	prof plum is researching sirens.
		siren is a web api

crypto:
neverending:
	morse code scripting
	level0: plain morse code
	level1: morse code then rot13
	level2: morse code but with dots and dashes flipped
	level3: morse code, and a substitution cipher
RSAyyyy:
	didn't solve
Jimmy:
	know two ciphertexts with same xor key
	so xor ciphertexts and get secret xor flag
	do analysis somehow, like with that guesser script

aessential:
	see aes_stealer.py
	flag: TUCTF{A3S_3CB_1S_VULN3R4BL3!!!!}
	general idea:
	guess 31 '^' and see then guess each letter appended to that,
	compare answers for first block to see which one it is
	now we know first character X
	so guess 30 '^'
	and 30 '^' then X then each letter to find second letter
	etc.



Misc:
Literal:
	redirects to fork-bomb
	view-source on /Literal.html
	comment has picture of bomb, made of letters
	choose letters that aren't 'o'
	TUCTF{R34L.0N35.4R3.D4NG3R0U5}
ancient:
	there is a lizard in the picture, and a clue about Gurney
	James Gurney is the creator of Dinotopia, which uses a footprint alphabet
	the flag is if_only_jurassic_park_was_like_this
